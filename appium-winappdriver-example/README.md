### Info

this directory contains a copy  of 


[basic java Samples for WinAppDriver](https://github.com/phystem/WinAppDriver-Sample)

### Usage
NOTE: the `WindowsApplicationDriver.msi` checks OS version and refuses to install on older than Windows 10 with the dialog "windows Application Driver is only supported on indows 10, Windows Server 2016 or higher"

To enable Developer mode without Visual Studio installed, follow the [instructions](https://www.softwareok.com/?page=Windows/10/APPs/3)

Technically you do not have to wait until Developer Mode Package is completely installed with launching `WinAppDriver.exe`. It is taking a very long time to have Remote tooling for desktop, and is unclear if it is even needed.

This directory contains a subset of the [https://github.com/eugenp/tutorials](https://github.com/eugenp/tutorials)
intended to be used with the [testNg-DataProviders](https://github.com/sergueik/testng-dataproviders).

The Google Spreadsheet API secret file `client_secret.json` is loaded from main resource directory but must not be checked in.
In the absence of the file some tests would fail.
